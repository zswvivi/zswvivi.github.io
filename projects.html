              <h5>ARDC User Study of Data Discovery: RDA search log and survey analysis</h5>
              <p><strong>The objective: </strong> The purpose of this project is to perform data analysis on four different types of datasets obtained from Research Data Australia (RDA). These datasets include RDA search logs, which record user interactions during data searches on RDA, Google logs from the Google console that show queries leading Google users to RDA, RDA surveys conducted on the RDA portal, and RDA collection records available in the RDA catalog. Through this data analysis, our goal is to determine the alignment of content and the quality of searches on RDA.</p>
              <p><strong>Our approach: </strong> To analyze content alignment, we categorized queries into top-level ANZSRC-FoR categories. We employed a large language model (LLM) and developed a customized prompt to classify various types of queries, including RDA search queries, Google queries, RDA survey queries, and RDA collection records. Our goal was to identify the specific information sought by users.  To assess search quality, we manually selected queries submitted by survey participants. We divided them into two groups: the first group consisted of queries that resulted in at least one click or a record/page view from a search result, while the second group included queries that did not generate any clicks. For each query, we analyzed the top ten matched records listed in the search log to evaluate their relevance to the corresponding query. </p>

              <h5>Chinese Medical T5</h5>
               <p><strong>The objective: </strong> This project is to utilize diverse medical text resources, such as annotated medical text and general medical text, to train a generative model capable of performing multiple tasks. One of the biggest hurdles in medical natural language processing (NLP) is the scarcity of labeled medical data. Furthermore, effectively sharing knowledge across various medical tasks remains a difficult problem. Thus, this project aims to enhance the performance of related tasks by promoting knowledge sharing between them.</p>
              <p><strong>The challenges: </strong> Firstly, designing each task in a text-to-text format to enable the model to comprehend the relationships among various knowledge elements. Secondly, each task requires a distinct output format, and some tasks necessitate strict adherence to the output format. Finally, converting free-format medical texts into a text-to-text format to effectively leverage the knowledge contained within them poses a significant challenge.</p>
              <p><strong>Our approach: </strong> We adopt an approach that involves the constant refinement of the task prefix and text-to-text format through an analysis of task similarities and differences as well as experimental outcomes. To control the generated output, we utilize several techniques for steerable generation, including constrained beam search, contrastive search, word selection through logits, and post-processing methods. </p>

              <h5>Medical diagnosis utilizing electronic health records (EHR)</h5>
               <p><strong>The objective: </strong> This task is to utilize an EHR (Electronic Health Record) generated by our self-diagnosis program that gathers information from users through a question-and-answer interface, in order to forecast potential illnesses. </p>
              <p><strong>The challenges: </strong> The EHRs used to train the model have been collected from multiple hospitals, resulting in variations in writing styles and the presence of noisy data. In addition, the training data set only encompasses a few hundred illnesses, and the data is not evenly distributed.</p>
              <p><strong>Our approach: </strong> The sentence embedding-based approach we employ offers several benefits, including improved interpretability and the ability to easily incorporate new data without requiring the model to be retrained from the beginning. Our approach to sentence embedding learning involves contrastive learning, allowing our model to represent EHRs as high-dimensional vectors. Predictions are then made by assessing the connections between new EHRs and historical EHRs in a high-dimensional space based on sentence embeddings. </p>
              <p><strong>Demo: </strong> is coming soon.</p>

              <h5>Detection of Medical Symptoms in User Queries</h5>
               <p><strong>The objective: </strong> The aim of this project is to develop a model that can accurately identify medical symptoms within user queries.</p>
              <p><strong>The challenges: </strong> User queries often contain colloquial language, making it difficult to extract symptoms using traditional methods.
Many users tend to describe their symptoms based on their personal feelings, rather than using medical terminology, which can be challenging for symptom detector to extract symptoms.</p>
              <p><strong>Our approach: </strong> Given that medical queries frequently contain informal language, we have formulated the task of symptom detection as a retrieval problem, as opposed to a normalization issue based on medical concepts. Our method for detecting symptoms utilizes a contrastive learning model with a hard negative mining technique. </p>
